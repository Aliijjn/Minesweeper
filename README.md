# Minesweeper ‚õèÔ∏èüß®
Welcome to Minesweeper! My take on the classic game, using my own basic graphics library built on top of `Windows.h`. When starting the game, you're prompted to select a field size and difficulty. You can either choose a premade setting or make a custom one. Then the game starts, and you're shown a blank mine field. Left-click a square to uncover it, and don't worry, the first move is always on an empty square. After that, you can start looking for mines and "flag" them by right-clicking on them, this will ensure that you don't accidentally blow yourself to bits. The game ends once you uncover all non-mines, or when you hit a mine. Enjoy!

## What I learned from this project ‚úÖ
- How to use and build upon the `Windows.h` API
- How to parse, load and display images onto the screen
- How to handle input from a mouse
- Cleanly parsing user input in C++

You can mark a blank square by pressing the right mouse button

My version of Minesweeper supports fields as big as your monitor can handle, so sweep to your heart's content!

As well as this, my Minesweeper has premade and custom field sizes and difficulties

An easy 20x20 grid versus a hard 20x20 grid

And no matter the difficulty of the level, it's guaranteed that your first move leaves you intact (this is done by initialising the level only after the first click)
